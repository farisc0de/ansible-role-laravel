# Ansible Role: Laravel Prepare

This Ansible role prepares a directory for Laravel application deployment by ensuring required folders exist, setting appropriate permissions, and creating a placeholder `.env` file. It is designed for use in CI/CD pipelines as a pre-deployment step.

---

## Features

- Creates the main Laravel application directory.
- Creates subdirectories required for Laravel (`storage`, `bootstrap/cache`, etc.).
- Sets correct ownership and permissions for directories.
- Provides a placeholder `.env` file for configuration.

---

## Requirements

- Ansible 2.9 or higher.
- Target host should have a user with permissions to manage Laravel application files.
- Ensure the `geerlingguy.composer` role or Composer is installed separately if required later.
